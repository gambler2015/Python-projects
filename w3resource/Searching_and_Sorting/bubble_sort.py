#Write a Python program to sort a list of elements using the bubble sort algorithm.
#each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped 
#if they are not in order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data 
#sets as its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2) where n is the
#number of items.
